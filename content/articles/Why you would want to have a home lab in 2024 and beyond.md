You might be wondering why would you want to have a home server ? Well there are several advantages and good reasons to do so:
- Privacy - Running your own server for stuff like photo and files backups, a media center where you have your favourite movies and tv shows stored can be beneficial in a lot of ways which we will see later in the article.
- Control your data - Knowing how big tech companies sell your data or use it to target ads when you browse the web, or the time when your favourite movie or tv show gets removed from the streaming service you are subscribed to, or when your digital purchase of a movie gets pulled down (yes it actually happened), having a home server to store them will be convenient in the long term.
- Free from vendor lock-in - Using services like Google photos and Google Drive to backup files and photos can get you locked into Google's ecosystem of apps and it can be tough to get off. Using open source and self hosted solutions means you are free to choose how and where you store your files.
- Protection from policy changes to software - There have been several instances of companies changing their privacy and usage policies which have upset people due to the predatory nature of the policies. Self hosted solutions generally dont happen to change their privacy policies since most of the control are vested on the user. Even if they happen to do something sketchy, you can easily find alternatives to most of the software.
- Cosplaying as sysadmin - If you are a person like me who likes to cosplay as sysadmin then you should absolutely have a home server! You can learn a lot about system administration through this.

 ## Where to start?
 The first thing you need to consider is what kind of services you think you need. Is it photos and files backup? Is it movies and TV shows? Is it music streaming? Is it security camera recording? The possibilities are endless. You can self host pretty much any software you can think of. Want security cameras but dont trust companies to keep the footage safe? You can easily setup a local only NVR and AI solution that doesn't use cloud servers to store or process video. This is just one example.
 
 Second thing you need to consider is hardware. For the most part you don't need super powerful hardware, in fact your old PC lying in the closet will work just fine. You might need to tweak and add few things before starting to use it. If you don't have an old PC you can get very cheap old workstation PCs that are being decommissioned from an office or a school. They tend to have bit old hardware but usable for a home server.  Now they can be bulky sometimes like Lenovo Thinkstations or HP workstations. Dell Optiplex can be a good choice from a budget and space occupancy standpoint. If you are planning to use the server as a storage or backup server or a media server then you should consider adding more storage. A small capacity SSD as the boot drive can be really useful for getting faster boot times and overall better performance. You should also consider  having redundant hard drives for data safety.

Third and the most important consideration is power consumption and fan noise. If you live somewhere with high electricity prices you would want to have a server that consumes less power. Something like Raspberry Pi or similar SBCs will work but you might run into compatibility issues with some software. There are several low powered mini PCs available in the market that can be good for this purpose provided you can upgrade RAM or SSD or add more storage later. If you want to use hard drives for storage then a proper PC case with standard PC hardware will be required.
